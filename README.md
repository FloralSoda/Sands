# Sands & Heatwave
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Sands game.

Sands is a 2.5D isometric voxel exploration and sandbox game. It is designed as a way for us to experiment with novel game mechanics and powerful integration of music into voxel games.


## Blurb
**Best enjoyed with headphones ðŸŽ§**

You find yourself stranded in the middle of a desert with nothing but dunes and the sweltering sun. The world is quiet and isolating with only the wind to keep you company. As you explore this seemingly empty expanse, you will come across small hints of life, such as dead plants, succulents and ruins. As you approach these and more, music and motif will start to fill your ears, your knowledge and comfort within the world directly correlating to the music score.

## Study
Currently, this game is geared to helping the programmer get familiar with working with the GPU, specifically graphics and rendering, as well as helping the programmer understand how to use middleware, such as wwise.\
The game's audio system will be built around helping the musician become familiar with developing music in game dev, as well as to experiment with new instruments, genres and methods of creating music.

The gameplay and writing will involve plenty of research into fantasy stories, desert civilisations and games like Factorio, Terraria and Minecraft.

## Contribution
This game is primarily a toy project for the two of us, and we intend to build most of the content with our own skills. That being said, if there are any issues, bugs or simply bad code, feel free to create an issue on the issue tracker or offer a pull request. I cannot guarantee I'll see them in a timely manner, but I will do my best to stay on top them.
